\part{Career summary and goals}

I have been building scientific software since I was an undergraduate in Singapore, where I discovered first-hand how a well-designed and easy-to-use scientific tool could answer novel and important questions, revealing previously unseen patterns in data. The Semantic Web has taken giant strides towards building thoroughly documented, reproducible scientific analyses using open source tools to analyse findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data. I want to be at the forefront of designing and building these tools and to train the scientists and scientific programmers who will take the next steps into the data-rich future of science.

\part{Other relevant experience}

I love teaching and am very interested in using pedagogically sound techniques to improve learning for my students, particularly through the active learning method. I took classes in pedagogy in graduate school and attended teacher training workshops on campus. Since 2018, I have been a certified instructor with \textit{The Carpentries} (\href{https://carpentries.org/}{carpentries.org}), a global community teaching foundational computational and data science skills to researchers in academia, industry and government. I've taught three Software Carpentry workshops so far; at each, I taught Python programming skills to 15-20 students.

I have been an editor on Wikipedia for over twenty years\footnote{My user page on Wikipedia is at \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gaurav}}. I am an active member of the North Carolina Wikipedians User Group\footnote{Details available at \url{https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/North\_Carolina\_Wikipedians}}, have organized local events at the University of Florida and at the University of Colorado.
